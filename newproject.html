        <p class="p"><strong>The</strong> selection of Afghan dried fruits includes fruits such as raisins, apricots,
            figs,
            cherries,
            prunes, dates, and
            mulberries. In the country, the process of drying fruits is a family business that has been passed
            down from one
            generation to another for many years. People typically dry their fruit in an entirely natural way
            either in the sun or,
            as it is the case with certain varieties of grapes, in unique 'raisin rooms' known as khasmish
            khana.</p>

        <p class="p"><strong>Afghan </strong>rugs are made of three elements: Warp (Base), Pile (Surface), and Dyes.
            First of all, let
            us
            start by explaining
            each of these elements. Afghan rugs can be categorized based on carpet pattern, weaving technic, and
            material. At the highest level, we have
            handmade rugs & carpets and handmade flatweave kilims. Then we have modern rugs and traditional
            tribal rugs and finally,
            we have categorizations based on design.</p>

            alt="Afghani Saffron">
        <p class="p"><strong> Saffron</strong> comes from the Crocus Sati flower, an autumnal flowering plant. During 1
            month,
            the bulbs
            blossom and it is the
            time of the meticulous harvesting of the stigmas, entirely by hand, taking the greatest care not to
            crush or break them. saffron is harvested in the lands of Afghanistan, which offer a unique blend of
            earth, water and sun. The rich and
            fertile soil, the purity and minerality of the water, a dry climate and abundant sunshine make it
            possible to produce
            one of the best saffrons in the world. <a href="https://oec.world/en/profile/country/afg" target="_blank">
